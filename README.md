## Notes

This is a Tic tac toe game was  made with VSCode, JavaScript, Node, eslint (for formatting), mocha and chai for testing.
It functions by asking the user if it wants to play tic tac toe. Then it ask's for a board length which can be up to 26 and a letter to use. After that it play's and X always goes first. There is Object-oriented programming elements in this because we break the game up into separate functions to test such as isValidMove, isBoardFull, getWinnerRows, etc.
